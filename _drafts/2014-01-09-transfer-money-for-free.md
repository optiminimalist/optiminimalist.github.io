One of the most challenging things about moving to the USA was to understand the banking system here. Coming from Europe, I was used to being able to transfer money between different accounts, banks, and even banks in different countries for free.

You can imagine the look on my face when I learned about my options to transfer money from my checking account to my other checking account at a different bank:

- pay for an ACH transfer (pay for a transfer?)
- pay for checks, write one and then deposit it (how many steps?)
- use BillPay (wait for more than a week to mail me a check?)

All I wanted was a button (or, more realistically, a series of buttons) to move money quickly and for free to a different financial institution. Luckily, Silicon Valley's latest craze has come to the rescue. Meet [Square Cash](https://square.com/cash).

## Square Cash

Square Cash lets you easily send money to your friends with just an email. The first time you send such a payment email, it will send both you and your friend setup instructions where you can link a debit card. Once this is set up, sending money is as simple as sending an email. (Disclaimer: In order to make use of the full weekly limit of $2500 you have to register your social security number).

So, I asked myself the question:

> What if I wanted to send money to myself - i.e. move it between my bank accounts?

Sure enough, I remembered the good old Gmail feature where you can assign 'labels' to your address.
